page: Write Tasks, Not User Stories
---
The "Write Tasks, Not User Stories" method advocates for a straightforward, task-oriented approach to project management and execution. This method suggests that while user stories can provide valuable context and help understand the user's perspective, they may sometimes lack the specificity required for immediate action. By focusing on tasks, you delineate clear, actionable steps that need to be taken, making it easier for team members to understand their responsibilities and how to execute them.

This approach involves breaking down projects into tangible tasks that can be acted upon directly. It's about moving from the why to the how, providing team members with clear directives and minimizing ambiguity. Writing tasks encourages a focus on execution, ensuring that each team member knows exactly what needs to be done, by when, and what success looks like.

Adopting this method doesn't mean disregarding the importance of user needs or the broader context of your work. Instead, it's about translating that understanding into direct action. By writing tasks, you bridge the gap between strategy and execution, ensuring that your team is not only aligned with the user's needs but also equipped with a clear roadmap for action.
