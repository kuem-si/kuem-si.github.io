It's essential for you and your entire team to strive for quick action and progress every day. Rather than simply discussing or contemplating a task, it's crucial to make a decision and take action promptly. This means tackling tasks today instead of putting them off until tomorrow, and accomplishing objectives within the week instead of waiting until the following week.

There may be weeks where it's unclear what the most critical task is, or you may be uncertain about a product decision. In those moments, it's important not to become immobilized. Instead, take action and trust your instincts. Consider engaging with more users to gain more insights and clarity as feedback rolls in. If you have established a process that facilitates rapid learning and progress, you can always make necessary adjustments or revert decisions if needed.
