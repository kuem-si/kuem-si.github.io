    question:
      "I recently received a request for my photo ID. Why does Lexington Themes UI need this? What should I do next?",
    answer:
      "Lexington Themes is legally required to complete what is called a KYC (Know Your Customer) Survey for every user that signs up, which includes completing identity verification for the person who chooses to be the owner, administrator, and representative of a Lexington Themes account. These requirements are intended to promote transparency and prevent individuals from using complex company structures to hide terrorist financing, money laundering, tax evasion, and other financial crimes.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why has Lexington Themes placed a reserve on my new account?",
    answer:
      "Reserves are utilized to keep processing volume available within your Lexington Themes account to fund refunds or chargebacks. There are several possible reasons a reserve may be placed at onboarding. It could be that your business operates in an industry or with a business model that potentially creates additional credit risk, even if you are not yet receiving chargebacks. Some businesses may also collect payment far in advance, creating additional risk. Most reserves are temporary, however, and we are happy to revisit if you provide additional information by replying to the notification email you received.",
